# AlgoRoute Explorer

## Description

**AlgoRoute Explorer** is a Python-based visualization tool that demonstrates the working of popular pathfinding algorithms like **A\*** (A-star) and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. The tool provides a user-friendly graphical interface where users can create grids, place obstacles, and observe in real-time how algorithms traverse the grid to find the shortest path. It is ideal for learning, teaching, and analyzing algorithm behavior in a visual manner.

## Features

- 🎯 **Supports A\* and BFS algorithms** for finding the shortest path.
- 🎨 **Real-time visual feedback** with color-coded cells.
- 🧱 **Interactive grid** to place start, end, and obstacle cells.
- ⏯️ **Controls** to start, reset, and run specific algorithms using keyboard input.
- 🧠 **Educational tool** for understanding graph traversal and DSA concepts.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x** 🐍
- **Pygame** for GUI and visualization 🎮
